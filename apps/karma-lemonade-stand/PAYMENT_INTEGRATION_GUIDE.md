# Devvit Payment Integration Guide

## Current Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è PLACEHOLDER IMPLEMENTATION

The current payment system is **NOT connected to real Devvit payments**. To receive actual payments, you need to complete the following steps:

## Required Steps for Real Payment Integration:

### 1. Update devvit.json (‚úÖ DONE)
The `devvit.json` has been updated with:
- `payments` permission
- Product definitions with SKUs, names, descriptions, and prices
- Payment enablement flag

### 2. Replace Payment Service Implementation

The current `PaymentService` class needs to be replaced with actual Devvit Payment API calls:

```typescript
// Replace the current processPurchase method with:
async processPurchase(userId: string, sku: string, quantity: number = 1): Promise<PaymentResult> {
  try {
    // Use Devvit's actual payment API
    const payment = await context.payments.createPayment({
      sku,
      quantity,
      userId
    });
    
    return {
      success: true,
      receiptId: payment.id,
      message: 'Purchase completed successfully'
    };
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      success: false,
      message: 'Payment failed',
      error: error.message
    };
  }
}
```

### 3. Update Receipt Verification

Replace the current receipt verification with Devvit's payment verification:

```typescript
async verifyReceipt(receiptId: string): Promise<{valid: boolean; receipt?: any}> {
  try {
    const payment = await context.payments.getPayment(receiptId);
    return {
      valid: payment.status === 'completed',
      receipt: payment
    };
  } catch (error) {
    return { valid: false };
  }
}
```

### 4. Add Payment Context to Main App

Update `src/main.tsx` to include payment context:

```typescript
import { Devvit } from '@devvit/public-api';

// Enable payments
Devvit.configure({
  payments: true
});

// Add payment event handlers
Devvit.addTrigger({
  event: 'PaymentCompleted',
  handler: async (event, context) => {
    // Handle successful payment
    console.log('Payment completed:', event.payment);
    // Update user's power-up inventory
  }
});
```

### 5. Developer Account Setup

Ensure your Reddit developer account (u/bitpixi) is properly configured:

1. **Verify Developer Status**: Confirm you're enrolled in Reddit's developer program
2. **Payment Account**: Set up payment receiving account (bank account, PayPal, etc.)
3. **Tax Information**: Complete any required tax forms (W-9, etc.)
4. **App Review**: Submit app for payment review if required

### 6. Testing Payments

Before going live:

1. **Use Devvit's Test Mode**: Test payments in sandbox environment
2. **Verify Receipt Flow**: Ensure receipts are properly validated
3. **Test Refunds**: Implement and test refund functionality if needed

### 7. Revenue Sharing

Understand Reddit's revenue sharing model:
- Reddit typically takes a percentage of in-app purchases
- Exact percentages may vary based on your developer agreement
- Review your developer agreement for specific terms

## Important Notes:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Implementation Issues:
- Payment processing is completely simulated
- No real money transactions occur
- Receipts are fake and not verifiable
- No connection to your payment account

### ‚úÖ What's Ready:
- Game logic for power-ups is implemented
- UI for purchasing is built
- Receipt validation framework exists
- Power-up effects are coded

### üîß What Needs Real Implementation:
- Actual Devvit Payment API integration
- Real receipt verification
- Payment event handling
- Error handling for payment failures

## Next Steps:

1. **Review Devvit Payment Documentation**: Check the latest Devvit docs for payment APIs
2. **Test in Development**: Use Devvit's payment testing tools
3. **Submit for Review**: Get payment functionality approved by Reddit
4. **Monitor Revenue**: Set up tracking for payment analytics

## Contact Reddit Support:

If you encounter issues:
- Check Devvit documentation: https://developers.reddit.com/
- Contact Reddit developer support
- Join the Devvit developer community

**Remember**: The current code will NOT generate real revenue until properly integrated with Devvit's payment system and your developer account is configured for payments.
